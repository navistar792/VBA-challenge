# VBA Challenge: Bootcamp Week 2 VBA Scripting

## Background

In this homework assignment, I used VBA scripting to analyze real stock market data. This is an exercise that I will be able to apply right away, since I use Excel to track my investment portfolio performance, and to maintain a list of potential stocks with performance data.

## Overview of Script

* Create a script that will loop through all the stocks for one year and output the following information:
* Table 2, columns I through L
  * Added the rows and column headers for the two new tables
  * Add the list of stocks to column I 
  * Populate the yearly change, percent change, and total stock volume columns
  * Other calculations
    * Find the first and last row for each stock symbol
    * Added an If statement to avoid a division by zero error
* Table 3, from columns O through Q
    * Use Max and Min to find the stock with the greatest increase and decrease, and the greatest volume
    * Find the stock with the greatest total volume   
    * Use Match to find the stock symbol for each of those three metrics
